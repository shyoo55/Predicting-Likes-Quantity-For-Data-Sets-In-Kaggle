# Predicting Likes Quantity For Data Sets In Kaggle 
by( Shaikha Bin Ateeq )


# Introduction :
Kaggle is a data science and machine learning online community. Users can use Kaggle to acquire and publish data sets, explore and build models in a web-based data-science environment, collaborate with other data scientists and machine learning experts, and compete in data science challenges.[1] However the number of likes on the dataset may be considered a significant point, as the selection of the dataset may depend on it, to develop a solution that aims to predict the number of likes on data set based on a machine learning algorithm; specifically, we will be using a linear regression model. To do so, we will use a scraped date from the Kaggle dataset in ‘computer since’ To accomplish the prediction


# Data Overview :

The data set for the model will be scraped from Kaggle website: https://www.kaggle.com/. The below table outlines the features that will be used to develop the prediction model. :

<ul>

<li> Dataset Name: The name of the dataset </li>
<li>Created By: the person how  published the dataset</li>
<li>Rank: There are three levels of award, Bronze, Silver and Gold </li>
<li>Like: number of like in the dataset</li>
<li>Download Size: download size of the dataset</li>
<li>Notebook: number of Jupyter notebooks of the dataset</li>
<li>View:The number of people who had viewed the data</li>



</ul>


# Tools:

To explore and analyze the data, I will be using Jupyter notebook to use python language and Python libraries, such as: 
<ul>
<li>Pandas and NumPy packages for data manipulation. </li>
<li>Matplotlib, seaborn library for data visualization. </li>
<li>BeautifulSoup library for web scraping. </li>
<li>Selenium is a Python library and tool used for automating web browsers </li>
<li>LinearRegression from the sklearn.linear_model package for applying the linear regression model </li>
</ul>
